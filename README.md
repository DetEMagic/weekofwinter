### How to run the project 
Got to the root of the project and write ```npm install``` to install all dependendcies. You need to have Node.js installed for npm to work.

Then, run ```npm run dev``` and go to ```http://localhost:3000/```

If that does not work then maybe you ran the project on another port than 3000
